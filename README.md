## ðŸ“Œ Gen-AI Implementation Details

###  Prompting

Every news article is fed into a carefully designed prompt structure that asks the model to:

- Summarize it in 3 bullet points
- Identify the context (why it matters)
- Generate a reflection/journaling/writing prompt for deeper thinking
- Format output with labels and clarity

Prompts are engineered to be short, but rich in instruction.

###  Structured Output

Instead of plain text, the AI returns structured JSON or block sections with labeled output:

- **Summary**: TL;DR format
- **Key Takeaways**: Bullet list
- **Why it Matters**: 1-2 line explanation
- **Reflection Prompt**: For user engagement

This makes it easier to render in frontend cards and re-use elsewhere.

###  Function Calling

We'll use **function calling** (e.g., with OpenAI-compatible models) to allow the AI to trigger backend tools based on user queries like:

- `fetchTopicSummary(topic)`
- `getNewsByCategory(category)`
- `generateDailyPrompt()`

This keeps the AI's role focused and clean, while letting the app remain responsive and dynamic.

###  RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

For deeper questions users may ask (e.g., "Whatâ€™s the full context behind the US inflation issue?"), we integrate a **RAG pipeline**:

- Use keywords from the user query
- Search cached or real-time content sources (news APIs, Wikipedia, etc.)
- Provide the result as `context` to the model
- Ask model to respond based on both context and prompt

This avoids hallucination and makes answers grounded in facts.
